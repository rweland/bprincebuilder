Software Requirements Document: Room Grid Layout Application
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the requirements for a single-page React application that allows users to search for rooms and arrange selected room images in a grid layout.

1.2 Project Description
The Room Grid Layout Application is a client-side web application that enables users to search through a collection of rooms and organize selected room images into a customizable 5x8 grid. The application provides a simple and intuitive interface for room selection and arrangement.

1.3 Scope
The application will be a purely client-side implementation using React. It will use static data from a static JSON file for room information and image locations. The application will consist of a single page with a split layout showing a grid on the left and a search interface on the right.

1.4 Definitions and Acronyms
Room Card: A UI component displaying room information and image
Grid Cell: An individual container within the 5x8 grid that can display a room image
Client-side: Application logic runs entirely in the user's browser
JSON: JavaScript Object Notation, the format for the static data file
2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective
This is a standalone web application that will operate entirely within a web browser. It does not require server-side processing beyond initial static file serving.

2.2 User Classes and Characteristics
The primary users will be individuals who need to organize room layouts or create visual arrangements of rooms. Users are expected to have basic computer literacy and familiarity with web interfaces.

2.3 Operating Environment
Web browsers: Latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
Devices: Desktop and laptop computers with minimum screen resolution of 1280x800
No server-side dependencies required beyond static file hosting
2.4 Design and Implementation Constraints
Client-side only implementation using React
Room data provided by a static JSON file
No backend or database requirements
Must maintain responsive design for various screen sizes
2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
Assumes the availability of room images referenced in the JSON data
Depends on modern browser features and JavaScript support
Assumes static hosting capability for deployment
3. Technology Stack
3.1 Frontend
Framework: React
State Management: React Hooks (useState, useContext)
UI Components: Custom components using functional style
Styling: CSS-in-JS using Emotion or styled-components
3.2 Backend
None required (client-side only)
3.3 Database
None required (static JSON file for data)
3.4 Infrastructure
Static file hosting (any web server capable of serving static files)
3.5 Third-party Services
None required
4. Functional Requirements
4.1 Grid Layout Display
4.1.1 The application shall display a 5x8 grid (40 cells) on the left side of the screen.

4.2.2 The search shall filter rooms by name as the user types.
4.2.3 Search results shall update in real-time without page reload.
4.2.4 Search functionality shall be case-insensitive.
4.2.5 The search area shall display matching room cards.
4.3 Room Card Display
4.3.1 Each room card shall display the room name.
4.3.2 Each room card shall display the room image.
4.3.3 Room cards shall be selectable by clicking.
4.3.4 Selected room cards shall have a visual indicator of selection.
4.4 Grid Cell Interaction
4.4.1 Users shall be able to click on an empty grid cell after selecting a room card.
4.4.2 Clicking a grid cell after room selection shall place the room image in that cell.
4.4.3 Filled grid cells shall display the room image.
4.4.4 Grid cells shall maintain their assigned images until explicitly changed.
4.5 Data Management
4.5.1 The application shall load room data from a local JSON file.
4.5.2 The JSON structure shall include at minimum: room ID, name, and image URL.
4.5.3 The application shall handle loading and parsing of the JSON data.
5. Non-Functional Requirements

5.1.1 The application shall load within 3 seconds on standard broadband connections.
5.1.2 Search results shall update within 300ms of user input.
5.1.3 Image placement in grid cells shall be instantaneous.
5.2 Security
5.2.1 The application shall validate input to prevent injection attacks.
5.2.2 The application shall use secure image loading practices.
5.3 Reliability
5.3.1 The application shall function without errors in supported browsers.
5.3.2 The application shall handle missing image URLs gracefully.
5.4 Availability
5.4.1 As a client-side application, availability depends solely on hosting solution.
5.5 Scalability
5.5.1 The application shall support JSON files with up to 1000 room entries without performance degradation.
5.6 Maintainability
5.6.1 Code shall follow React best practices and component-based architecture.
5.6.2 Components shall be modular and reusable.
5.6.3 Code shall include JSDoc comments for all components and functions.
5.7 Internationalization
5.7.1 Not required for initial version.

8.1 Sample Data
A sample JSON file structure for room data:
```
{
    "rooms": [
        {
            "id": null,
            "imageUrl": "",
            "name": "The Foundation",
            "chess": null,
            "color": "blue",
            "category": "blueprint"
        }
}
```
8.2 Mockup Description
The application layout will consist of:

A header with the application title
A main content area split into two sections:
Left section (~60% width): 5x8 grid of square cells
Right section (~40% width): Search bar at top, scrollable results below
Responsive design that maintains functionality at various screen sizes
